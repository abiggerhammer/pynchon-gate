Here's "Maas", a trivial Pynchon Gate collator written in Python.

Maas is COMPLETELY UNTESTED, and is probably broken in lots of ways.

Maas requires M2Crypto, since that's the only python crypto lib I
could find that let me read PEM-encoded RSA private keys and sign
things with them.

Maas takes as input a private RSA key file and a directory:

     maas.py key.pem directory

It generates two new files, "my-dist.meta" and "my-dist.bs8192", to
contain all the files in the directory.

Maas does not follow pynchon-spec.txt exactly; see spec-changes.txt
for information.

Maas is COMPLETELY UNTESTED, and is probably broken in lots of ways.

It doesn't do the work of managing userIDs over time: instead, it
requires that every user's data be stored in one file in the directory
you give it.  Either you can specify the userID by making the file's
name a 64-byte hex string (corresponding to a 32-byte userID); or maas
will set the userID to a SHA256 hash of the filename.
