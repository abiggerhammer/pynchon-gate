Maas differs from the format described in section 3.2 of pynchon-spec.txt

Here, the formats are:

   Metadata:
         Version: 4 bytes
         Bucket size: 4 bytes.
         Nymserver name: HASH_LEN*2 bytes.
           (Meant to be human readable.)
         Nymserver identity: HASH_LEN bytes.
           (Hash of nymserver public key)
         File name: HASH_LEN*2 bytes.
           (Name of the "file" that this distribution was meant to hold.
            This is meant to replace the idea of numbering cycles.)
         Distribution digest: HASH_LEN bytes
           (Digest of the entire distribution file.)
         Number of entries in the metaindex==MLEN: 4 bytes
         Metaindex: MLen * (HASH_LEN*2) bytes
           (A bunch of metainfo entries, described below)
         SigLen: 4 bytes
         Signature: SigLen bytes

   The protocol version for this version of the spec is 0.

   Signature is an RSA signature of the hash of the metadata up through
   "metaindex", using RSASSA_PSS padding (because that's what I could make
   m2crypto support).

   Metaindex entry

      UID    First UserID in index bucket [HASH_LEN octets]
      IDX_H  Hash of index bucket         [HASH_LEN octets]

   Index entry

      UID    UserID                               [HASH_LEN octets]
      M_IDX  Index of user's first message bucket [4 octets]
      M_OFF  Offset of the user's first message within the user's first
             bucket (always 0 for now)            [4 octets]
      M_H    Hash of user's first message bucket  [HASH_LEN octets]

   Message bucket

      H      Hash of next message bucket          [HASH_LEN octets]
      DATA   Packaged message data                [BlockSize-HASH_LEN octets]


Anything that doesn't fill up a bucket is padded with 0-bytes.

See README for info on how userids are generated for now.
